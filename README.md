========

Rewrote much of the code from SuperVFD to make it less hideous and more user friendly.
Still drives a VFD.

#Currently supports:
 - most alphanumeric characters on alphanumeric digits
 - hexadecimal digits on 7-segment displays
 - all extra segments like fan and AM/PM indicators. 
 - IR transmission and recieving
 - radioshack's LED strip (if you really want it to)
 - reading from microSD card
 - timer interrupt-based variable frequency square wave generator. 
 - probably some other things I forgot
